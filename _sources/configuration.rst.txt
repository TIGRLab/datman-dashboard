Configuration Glossary
----------------------

Listed below are all configuration values that may be set for the QC dashboard.
They're organized into sections based on the feature that they configure.
These values should be set in your shell (or your uWSGI configuration file).


Cluster
*******
Allows the dashboard to make use of a computing cluster (e.g.
`Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html>`_).

Optional
^^^^^^^^
* **DASHBOARD_QSUBMIT_CMD**

  * Description: Tells the dashboard which command to use when submitting
    a job. If the command is not available on your PATH, you should provide
    the full path (e.g. /usr/bin/sbatch instead of sbatch).
  * Default value: ``sbatch``
* **DASHBOARD_QSUBMIT_OPTIONS**

  * Description: Options to use when submitting each queue job. This is the
    ideal place to set things like a default working directory or QoS.
  * Default value: ``--chdir=/tmp/``
* **DASHBOARD_QSUBMIT_SCRIPTS**

  * Description: The path to a folder that will hold all of the scripts the
    dashboard may submit to the queue. If unset, the dashboard will search for
    a folder named "queue_jobs" inside the folder where its code resides.
  * Default value: ``../dashboard/queue_jobs``

Example
^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: bash

  # Using a non-standard submit command location
  export DASHBOARD_QSUBMIT_CMD=/home/user1/sbatch

  # Override the working directory + add a QoS
  export DASHBOARD_QSUBMIT_OPTIONS=--qos=dashboard --chdir=/home/user1/

  # Set a location for submit scripts
  export DASHBOARD_QSUBMIT_SCRIPTS=/home/user1/job_scripts

Database
********
Configure the database backend for the dashboard.

    left unset ONLY if a password-less authentication method like identd has
    been configured for the database.
