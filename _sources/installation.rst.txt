------------
Installation
------------

You have several options for how to run the QC dashboard and these are
listed below.

#. `Run with Docker Compose`_
    * `Development`_
    * `Production`_
    * `Connecting to the Containers`_
#. `Do a Full Install`_


Run with Docker Compose
-----------------------
#. `Install Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_, if you don't
   already have it.
#. Create the datman container config files as described `here <http://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/datman/installation.html>`_
#. Clone the `QC dashboard. <https://github.com/TIGRLab/dashboard.git>`_

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/TIGRLab/dashboard.git

#. Create two environment variables, ``DASH_ARCHIVE`` and ``DASH_CONFIG``,
   that hold the full path to your archive (data) folder and config file
   directory, respectively. If they're left unset, the container will use
   the docker-compose.yml folder for both locations. Note that your Datman
   main config file should be in your this ``DASH_ARCHIVE`` folder. By default
   the container expects this to be named ``main_config.yml`` and expects it to
   contain a system config block named 'docker'. For more information, see
   the datman configuration documentation `here <http://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/datman/installation.html>`_

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're running a development instance of the dashboard, after completing the
above steps you can change to the ``dashboard/containers/devel`` folder and run
the dashboard app with docker compose.

By default the development instance runs with ``login_disabled=True`` set
so OAuth doesn't need to be configured. However, if you need to test login
related features or features that require a user to be a dashboard admin you
must set up OAuth and add a user to the database's 'users' table. Set
``dashboard_admin`` and ``account_active`` to true for this user, in addition
to setting ``login_disabled=False`` in the docker-compose file.

Note that if you need to change or set any app settings, you can modify the
``dashboard.env`` and ``database.env`` files in ``dashboard/containers``.

   .. code-block:: bash
      cd dashboard/containers/devel
      docker compose up

Production
^^^^^^^^^^
If you're running a production instance of the dashboard there are a few extra
steps to take.

#. Get an OAuth client ID and client secret `from GitHub. <https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app>`_
   In the 'Authorization callback URL' field, be sure to add ``/callback/github``
   to the end of your homepage URL.

   You'll need to provide the Client ID and Client Secret to the dashboard
   later so be sure to record them.

#. Fill in your configuration. 

   * Add your dashboard configuration in ``dashboard/containers/dashboard.env``.
     At a minimum you should provide a flask secret key, a database password,
     an OAuth secret key, and an OAuth client ID. For information on 
     configuring the dashboard :ref:`see here <glossary>`.
   * Add your database configuration in ``dashboard/containers/database.env``.
     Note that the database password in this file should match the one in 
     ``dashboard.env``
#. Switch to the production container folder and run the app

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd dashboard/containers/prod
      docker compose up

#. You will likely also want to configure your own nginx server to
   sit in front of the uwsgi server. See the nginx section at the end of the
   'Full Install' instructions for setup info.

Connecting to the containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If everything started up correctly, you'll be able to access the dashboard
in your browser at ``localhost:5000``. If you need to connect to the database
while the app is running, you can do it by connecting to the postgres
container and then running psql as shown below.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Open an interactive shell inside the running dash_postgres container
    docker exec -it dash_postgres /bin/bash
    # Connect to the database as user dashboard inside the
    # dash_postgres container
    psql -U dashboard dashboard

You can also connect to the database from your local machine with psql. First,
make sure you have ``psql`` installed (you can get it with
``sudo apt install postgresql-client`` on Ubuntu 20.04) and
run this command from a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    # You can run this directly from your terminal
    psql -U dashboard -p 5432 -h localhost dashboard

You will be prompted for the ``POSTGRES_PASSWORD`` from the
``containers/database.env`` file.

Do a Full Install
-----------------
A full install gives you the most control over your configuration. If you're
considering this you should be prepared for a long installation process. Note
that all the example paths and installation commands provided below are for
Ubuntu 20.04 and may differ if you're using another operating system.

#. `Install Datman <http://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/datman/installation.html>`_
   and set up its configuration files.
#. Clone the `QC dashboard. <https://github.com/TIGRLab/dashboard.git>`_

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/TIGRLab/dashboard.git
#. Install the dashboard's python dependencies. Note that the dashboard is
   meant to run on python 3.5 or higher.

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Make a virtual environment
      python3 -m venv $YOUR_ENV_PATH/venv

      # Activate your environment
      source $YOUR_ENV_PATH/venv/bin/activate

      # Install required packages
      pip install -r $DASHBOARD_PATH/requirements.txt
#. Set up `PostgreSQL. <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>`_ The
   dashboard was tested against PostgreSQL 12 and all examples below assume
   this is the version in use. Newer versions should work as well, however.

   * Install PostgreSQL.

     .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install postgresql-12

   * Make postgres use a more secure password storage method.

     * Open the ``postgresql.conf`` file. e.g. ``nano /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf``
     * Uncomment the line for the ``password_encryption`` setting
     * Change it to ``password_encryption = scram-sha-256``

   * Allow the dashboard user to connect to the dashboard database with a password.

     * Open the ``pg_hba.conf`` file. e.g. ``nano /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf``
     * Beneath the comment that says "Put your actual configuration here", add
       an entry like this::

        #     database name  database user     connection method
        local dashboard      dashboard         scram-sha-256
     * Reload the configuration files to make the changes take effect.

       .. code-block:: bash

          sudo systemctl reload postgresql

     * Add the dashboard user to the database.

       .. code-block:: bash

          # Save the password you use. You'll use it every
          # time you connect to the database.
          sudo -u postgres createuser -P dashboard
   * Initialize the database.

     * Create an empty database that's owned by the dashboard user.

       .. code-block:: bash

          sudo -u postgres createdb -O dashboard dashboard

     * Activate your virtual environment, if you havent yet.

       .. code-block:: bash

          source $YOUR_ENV_PATH/venv/bin/activate

     * Set the environment variables needed for flask migrate to run.

       .. code-block:: bash

          # Replace "/full/path/to/datman" with the full
          # path to your datman folder.
          export PATH=/full/path/to/datman:${PATH}
          export PYTHONPATH=/full/path/to/datman:${PYTHONPATH}

          # This secret key is needed but is temporary
          # so can be anything for now
          export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=mytemporarysecretkey

          export POSTGRES_USER=dashboard
          export POSTGRES_PASS=YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD_HERE

     * Switch to your dashboard directory and run the command below to create
       the database tables.

       .. code-block:: bash

          flask db upgrade

#. Get an OAuth client ID and client secret `from GitHub. <https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app>`_
   In the 'Authorization callback URL' field be sure to add ``/callback/github``
   to the end of your homepage URL.

   You'll need to provide the Client ID and Client Secret to the dashboard
   later so be sure to record them.

#. Configure the uWSGI server.

   * Install uWSGI.

     .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install uwsgi

        # On some platforms (such as Ubuntu 20.04) you also
        # need the python3 plugin. After installation you
        # may need to restart your computer
        sudo apt install uwsgi-plugin-python3
   * Create a ``dashboard.ini`` config file in uWSGI's apps-enabled folder.
     (e.g. ``/etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/dashboard.ini``)

   * Add your configuration. At a minimum you should add the settings
     described below. For more information and a list of all dashboard settings
     see :ref:`here. <glossary>` Any Datman settings you need should also be
     added here. For a list of uWSGI options see their documentation
     `here <https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html>`_

     .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]

        module = wsgi:app
        chown-socket = www-data
        plugins = python3,logfile

        # Needed to prevent the scheduler from locking up
        lazy-apps = True

        # This should be the path to your dashboard folder
        chdir = PATH_TO_YOUR_DASHBOARD_HERE
        # This is the virtualenv uwsgi will use when
        # running the dashboard
        virtualenv = PATH_TO_YOUR_VIRTUALENV_HERE

        # This controls the user and group the app will run under.
        # Replace it with a real username/group.
        uid = YOURUSER
        gid = YOURGROUP

        # Dashboard + Datman env variables can be set here
        # Below shows only the minimum required variables that
        # must be set to run the app.

        # Set this to something unguessable and keep it private
        # or user sessions will be compromised
        env = FLASK_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_VERY_SECURE_KEY_HERE

        env = POSTGRES_USER=dashboard
        env = POSTGRES_PASS=YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD

        env = OAUTH_CLIENT_GITHUB=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
        env = OAUTH_SECRET_GITHUB=YOUR_GITHUB_SECRET

        # Configure datman here too
        env = PYTHONPATH=PATH_TO_YOUR_DATMAN_FOLDER_HERE
        env = DM_SYSTEM=YOUR_SYSTEM_NAME
        env = DM_CONFIG=PATH_TO_YOUR_MAIN_CONFIG_HERE

   * Restart uWSGI to force it to re-read the configuration.

     .. code-block:: bash

        sudo systemctl restart uwsgi

#. Configure nginx to serve the uWSGI dashboard app.

   * Install nginx

     .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install nginx

   * Add a ``dashboard.conf`` file to nginx's sites-enabled folder.
     (e.g. ``/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dashboard.conf``)

     At a minimum you should add a server entry, like the one shown below,
     with your server's name filled in. Note that this example configuration
     is for HTTP only and should not be used outside of a private network.

     .. code-block:: bash

        server {
          listen 80;
          server_name localhost YOURSERVERNAMEHERE;

          location / {
            include uwsgi_params;
            uwsgi_pass unix://var/run/uwsgi/app/dashboard/socket;
          }
        }
